Updates in v0.6.2

PLOTTING
1. Added plot_stations() to plot seismic station map using GMT

2. Fixed minor bugs in plot_waveform()

3. Updated plot_corrfile() to take more options, more consistent with CorrData.plot()


DOWNLOADERS

2. Added points_in_polygon() and generate_points_in_polygon()
3. Added read_gmtlines() to read in line segments in GMT style.
4. Added read_ncmodel3d to read 3-D model files in netCDF format.
5. Added read_ncmodel2d to read 2-D model files in netCDF format.
6. Added ncmodel_in_polygon to extract seismic model within polygons.

TYPES
1. Pushed cc_len and cc_step in CorrData.
2. Added in CorrData.stack() the option to stack over segmented time windows.
